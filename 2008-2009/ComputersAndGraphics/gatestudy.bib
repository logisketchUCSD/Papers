	Year = {1991},
	Abstract = {Gesture-Based interfaces offer an alternative to traditional keyboard,
	menu, and direct manipulation interfaces. The ability to specify
	objects, an operation, and additional parameters with a single intuitive
	gesture appeals to both novice and experienced users. Unfortunately,
	gesture-based interfaces have not been extensively researched, partly
	because they are difficult to create. This paper describes GRANDMA,
	a toolkit for rapidly adding gestures to direct manipulation interfaces.
	The trainable single-stroke gesture recognizer used by GRANDMA is
	also described.},
